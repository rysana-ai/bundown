# Multi-language Hello

Here's a simple example of multi-language scripting in Bundown, saying hello in different languages.

```ts
console.log('Hello from TypeScript!');
```

```js
console.log('Hello from JavaScript!');
```

```sh
echo 'Hello from Shell!'
```

```py
print('Hello from Python!')
```
